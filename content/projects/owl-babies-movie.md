*Co-authored with Claude (Anthropic)*

## What it is

An animated short film adaptation of *Owl Babies* by Martin Waddell - the story of three baby owls (Sarah, Percy, and Bill) waiting anxiously for their mother to return.

**Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress

## Why I'm making it

My daughter loves this book. We've read it probably a hundred times. The story's simple emotional arc - fear of abandonment, sibling comfort, joyful reunion - hits different as a parent.

I wanted to see if AI tools (Veo for video generation, Gemini for images) could help bring this to life in a way that captures the warmth of the original illustrations.

## The approach

- **Visual style:** Needle-felt / folk art aesthetic - warm, textured, handcrafted feel
- **AI tools:** Google Veo 3.1 for video clips, NanoBanana (Gemini) for style frames and storyboards
- **Audio:** Planning to record narration with family

## Learnings so far

- Veo's 8-second clip limit means thinking in short shots
- Consistent character design across AI-generated frames is *hard*
- The needle-felt style actually works well with AI's tendency toward soft, dreamy imagery

*More updates as this progresses.*
