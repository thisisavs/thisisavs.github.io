![Competitor News Digest - Agentic Flow](/project-images/competitor-news-digest-cover.png)

## Overview

A multi-agent system built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that automates competitor intelligence workflows for tracking industry news and M&A activity.

**Status:** Completed

**Repo:** [thisisavs/agents_capstone](https://github.com/thisisavs/agents_capstone)

## What It Does

The system streamlines competitive intelligence by automating four key stages:

1. **Collect** — Gathers web-based competitor news via Google Search
2. **Triage** — Filters items for strategic significance
3. **Analyze** — Deep-dives on major events (M&A deals, partnerships)
4. **Deliver** — Produces executive briefings and detailed reports

## Technologies

- **Python** — Core implementation
- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** — Agent orchestration
- **LlmAgent & LoopAgent** — Agent components for reasoning and iteration
- **Google Search** — News collection
- **Nanobanana Pro** — Infographic generation for leadership presentations

---

## Key Features

- **Automated news collection** from configurable competitors (Eaton, Schneider Electric, Vertiv)
- **M&A intelligence reporting** with structured analysis of deals and strategic implications
- **Executive news digests** organized by company
- **Infographic generation** for visual summaries
- **Markdown report output** for version control and sharing
- **State-based data flow** — transparent information passing between agents
