Wearables are the order of the day!!

It's no hyperbole to say that our lives are going to be completely revamped by these wearables.

Imagine a device that can analyze your vitals and streamline the data for you to keep a tab on your health.

How cool would it be to have a [tattoo on throat](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/12/tech/innovation/google-throat-tattoo/) that can replace an earpiece dangling by your side that needs to be adjusted all the time.

[Tattoo's](http://mashable.com/2014/04/07/electronic-tattoo/) that can check your vitals and release drugs automatically - there is no end to the range of products that can be developed. So we bring to you some of the coolest gadgets available out there.

Here is a list of few things that caught our interest:

### 1. [Google Glass!!](http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it-does/)

Google always does things in style, and well they did it again. Google Glass brings instant notifications and alerts on the go, and the best part is you don't need a smart phone for this to work. You can get directions, fitness alerts and lot more. One thing that stands out is the alerts and valuable info it pumps in that's helping professionals in their work. But it gives such a dorky look to the wearer - but Google is working on it as well.

### 2. Samsung Gear 2

Samsung has updated their range of smart wrist watches that stand out among their lot. Mail alerts and Social notifications are available and it has this added Heart rate sensor and Pedometer that tracks your fitness. Another cool addition is its WatchON Remote app that lets you control your TV station and your set top boxes. There are other variants like Fit, Neo. Oh!! another thing - it comes with an on board 2.0 MP cam, and you can control your phone's camera with your gear. This has got serious competition from the likes of Sony Smart Watch, fashionable Moto 360, Pebble, Toq and reportedly THE iWatch!!!!

### 3. [Nod Ring](https://www.hellonod.com/)

This bluetooth enabled gesture controller enables us to perform almost every action like swipe, scroll, type and zoom. Their introductory video is cool and will surely blow you away. It tags along with your smart phone and has two customizable buttons on it as well that lets you play games, surf web and lots more.

### 4. [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up)

Though this doesn't have a display, this tracker keeps a note of all your activities, the time you sleep, calories burned, your eating patterns. All in all this keeps a tab on things you do and alerts you about your sleep patterns, food and calorie tracking, and on top of everything it vibrates asking you to move your butt 'cos you are idle for too long!!! Oh crap..

### 5. [Smart Diapers](http://pixiescientific.com/pages/smart-diapers)

Yeah. Why not get smart about your child's piss... What? This is wearable isn't it... this is not something out of this post's context. So here we go. These diapers have a colorful box just at the place the baby pisses and this box turns even more colorful once the child pees. All you've gotta do is to click a photo of that box and the results will be on your phone in no time. This is some serious stuff and we aren't kidding. These diapers can detect some serious UTI, dehydration and Type I diabetes as well.

P.S: How many of you still remember the Casio's Calculator Watch you showed off at school... I do.. Ah!! Sweet memories, cool aren't they ;-)
