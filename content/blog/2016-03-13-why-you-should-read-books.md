Books!! Stephen King says "Books are uniquely portable Magic".

There are hundreds of posts giving 10, 20 reasons as to why you should read. Even I used to give those same cliched reasons to my book-hater friends. Yeah, I'm talking about all those reasons like: reading is fun, it is stimulating, increases verbal ability, focus, improves memory, Blah blah, blah.

But you know what, those reasons may be backed by research but nobody gives a shit. Heck that's not even why we (or I) read. There is only one reason that gives a hard-on if I think of books, and that is:

> ## **Every time you hold a book, you have access to knowledge only ONE IN 700,000 people has!!**

Intrigued? Let me explain:

## How many copies do you think a book would sell?

**First let's look at best sellers:**

According to How Stuff Works's list of best sellers: ["Don Quixote" with 500 million copies](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/21-best-sellers1.htm) is the largest selling book of all time. Going by that number, and given the fact that there are about some 7 billion people in the world. If we do the simple math to get **what percentage of people would have access to that knowledge**:

No. Of people = (500,000,000) / (7,000,000,000) × 100 = **~7%**

So of all the people on earth only 7% has access to that knowledge! You think that is cool? No...

Remember **not every book hits the 500 million copies mark**. The best sellers you have heard of like "Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Alchemist, Da Vinci Code, etc." averages about 50-100 million copies only ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books)). Now if you run the numbers again taking a realistic "100 million" as average no. of copies sold for a bestseller, the number is down to **1.4%**.

## But, these are BEST SELLERS. What about a random book? Any book.

If we look at [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books), only **140 books** ever sold more than 10 million copies. And **129,864,880** is the exact number of books published until now in history according to [Google](http://mashable.com/2010/08/06/number-of-books-in-the-world/). So even 1.4% is not realistic.

If we are talking about any random book, on an average a book will sell some [10K copies](http://www.stevelaube.com/what-are-average-book-sales/) in its lifetime, which is as generous an estimate as it can get. Now if we run the numbers i.e. 10K / 7 billion:

**The odds that the book you are holding right now is owned by others is 1 in 700,000.** Crazy isn't it?

To put that in perspective, you wanna know what else has the same odds:

> "The odds that the person right in front of you now has participated in 2012 London Olympics"

Yeah! [10,768 participated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics) in 2012 Summer Olympics at London.

So next time you look at any book think of these odds, and remember:

> ## **Whenever you buy a book, what you actually buy is access to knowledge only a select few could possibly have in the world.**
