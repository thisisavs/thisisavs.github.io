## Half filled glass!!

I know what's running through your mind right now, "Oh God!! Not again." Well I've been in that situation half my life.

Every self help book I read or every damn motivational speaker I have listened to brings up this famous question. But please bear with me a min and I will give you a different perspective.

![Half empty glass - how do you see this?](/blog-images/half-empty-glass-008.jpg)

The standard procedure being:
- Shoot the Q
- If answer is half full = Optimist, Half empty = Pessimist

Now that's the old way of drawing inference. So what's the better way to see it?? Well I would say:

> ### "The glass is half filled with water and half with air"

Likewise an empty glass is never literally empty. There is always air ready to rush in to fill things. The point I am trying to get across is - no matter how bad or even worse situations appear, there will always be something for us to hold on to, some little ray of hope. Things are never really that bad as they appear to be. So all we need to do is believe in our efforts and move on.

> ## "Nothing is permanent except change"

So always be a "**Perennial Optimist**". There is nothing wrong in being too damn Optimistic!! What may appear a failure to others about your life may be THE biggest lesson you ever learn. And who knows, maybe that lesson may make you the next Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs!!

Interesting isn't it that we are always told how successful they are, but their success is the result of this Perennial Optimism. How often have we heard about Henry Ford and his V8 engine? Didn't we hear about Steve Jobs and his monomaniacal ideas dismissed as crazy at first and later embraced?

That is how things work - "We gotta believe in ourselves and always try to find the positive side."

Cheers!!!!
