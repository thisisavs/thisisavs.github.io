![Question](/blog-images/question.jpg)

We are all taught how to solve problems but isn't "problem formulation" the real problem?

How can we solve problems when if we do not see problems? How can we expect people to solve problems that they are not even aware of?

We just know things as a matter of fact, but who is ready to find the problems, formulate the problems? Think of development - didn't each one of them come out of questioning? What is questioning but problem formulation?

People can only solve problems when they see them. So why aren't we teaching problem formulation?

Solve that and that's it - Vroom goes the development!!! To come up with solutions there should be a proper problem in place.

> **"A good problem precedes a good solution."**

What, you are not convinced? Fine!!

I can go on and on but I think I've made my point.

We think great people are great because they solve big problems, but I say they ask big questions.

Think of Dalai Lama - did he solve the Tibetan problem? But he is asking the right questions. Edward Snowden - was he able to stop surveillance? But he showed us a problem.
