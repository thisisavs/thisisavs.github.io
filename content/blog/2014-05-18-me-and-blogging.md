So how did all this start?? Well having completed my Undergrad studies and while waiting to get into some Univ for my masters, I found a wonderful opportunity in blogging to keep me engaged. Writing is something I thoroughly enjoy.

I am not going to stick to any particular topic so that I've lot many options to write about ;-) I Hope that my posts are well worth your time. Suggestions and corrections are very much appreciated. Feel free to drop in your comments.
